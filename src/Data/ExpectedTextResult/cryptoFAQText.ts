Why use Bitcoins?

Because it's independent, secure, simple/private, fast, uncostly.

Independent. Bitcoin is not controlled by any government, bank or any other financial intermediary. All of the above have no way to interrupt user transactions, freeze Bitcoin accounts etc. The system is purely peer-to-peer and Bitcoin value cannot be forcibly changed by a political action.

Simple and private. Transferring Bitcoins to another part of the world requires only an Internet connection and a wallet application. By contrast, traditional bank transfers require excessive documentation and bureaucracy. Furthermore, the Bitcoin network does not store or require any of your personal data. You are in full control of your transactions. Bitcoin is the definition of privacy, you just cannot get more private than that.

Cheap. With the use of cryptography, secure payments are possible without the need to pay an intermediary financial institution. Bitcoin offers the ability to store money and transfer it instantly, anywhere, at near-zero cost.
